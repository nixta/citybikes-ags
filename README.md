===============

A node.js "ArcGIS Server" to provide an AGS bridge to api.citybik.es

This ReadMe is incomplete. Just a placeholder.

This node.js project handles a subset of ArcGIS Server requests to describe services and return query results.

It makes use of the two api calls availanble at [CityBik.es](http://api.citybik.es) to request up-to-date bike 
share information for bike share systems around the world, and present them as Feature Services on an ArcGIS Server.
